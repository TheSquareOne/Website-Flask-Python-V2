# Website-Flask-Python-V2

This is my second try of learning python and making my own web-server using flask.
I realized things i could have made better in my first project, but refactoring would have been too hard, so i decided to make whole new project to keep things clean and understandable for myself.

Things to improve: classes, file structure, virtual environment, comments and usage of libraries i found during my first researches.

Versions:
Python:   3.6.9
Flask:    1.1.2
Werkzeug: 1.0.1


Python scripts:
app.py          Base app code
__init__.py     Initialize flask, and configurations
routes.py       URL routes
forms.py        Create secure web forms with Flask-WTF
config.py       Include application configurations


HTML pages:
index.html      Front side of web-server. Maybe add some kind of dashboard features and public stuff (blogs, projects) in future here.
template.html   Template for all pages. Includes basic head information, CSS and code block placements.
login.html      User login page.
