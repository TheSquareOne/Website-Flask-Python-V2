# Website-Flask-Python-V2

This is my second try of learning python and making my own webserver using flask.
I realized things i could have made better in my first project but refactoring would have been too hard so i decided to make whole new project to keep things clean and understandable for myself.

Things to improve: classes, file structure, comments and usage of libraries i found during my first researches.
