# Website-Flask-Python-V2

This is my second try of learning python and making my own web-server using flask.
I realized things i could have made better in my first project, but refactoring would have been too hard, so i decided to make whole new project to keep things clean and understandable for myself.

Things to improve: classes, file structure, virtual environment, comments and usage of libraries i found during my first researches.

Versions:
Python:   3.6.9
Flask:    1.1.2
Werkzeug: 1.0.1


Python scripts:
app.py        Base app code
__init__.py   Initialize flask
routes.py     URL routes
